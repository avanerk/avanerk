# Hi, I'm Avanerk ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with an interest in building scalable systems and improving development workflows through DevOps practices.  
I also enjoy running and managing my own home server to self-host services and experiment with infrastructure.

I'm always learning and refining my skills across backend, frontend, and infrastructure.

If you'd like to reach out, feel free to open a pull request or an issue on any of my repositories.
